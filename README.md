# Throwing Pebbles Mod [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/PedroRaymundi/throwing-pebbles-mod)](https://github.com//PedroRaymundi/throwing-pebbles-mod/blob/master/LICENSE)
This is a mod i did to learn some java and have fun. It adds revolutionizing stuff as breaking rocks and throwing them. I know that such technology seems complicated but its actually really easy to just start using this mod when playing.

## New Items
Item|Description|Materials
---------|--------------|-----
Pebble|Just your average pebble that you can use for a lot of things... like throwing at mobs|Cobblestone
Magma Pebble|It's another pebble, but guess what, it also burns the target|Magma Block
Fish Pebble|Pufferfish is kinda useless in the base game, you just kill them and keep in a chest like a sicko. So how about use them to throw at people and give some poison effects?|Pufferfish and Pebble
Slingshot|Yeah yeah, you _can_ use your hands, but if the target is far away you will need that extra range|Sticks and String

PS: maybe i will add some more things, I don't know.
